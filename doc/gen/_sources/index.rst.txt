Analyzing PISA and World Bank Educational Data
----------------------------------------------
Background
^^^^^^^^^^
Equity is a fundamental value and guiding principle for education policies, but it is not necessarily equally fulfilled among education systems around the world. In order to investigate educational equity in the difference of academic performance between gender groups, females and males, we collect international education data from PISA and World Bank.

PISA is an international assessment of 15-year-old students’ capabilities in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy as well as measuring a wider range of factors including students’ interest, attitudes and motivation. It is distributed across over 60 countries, and student background questionnaires and teacher questionnaires are collected as part of PISA assessment. Student scores vary greatly for different student subpopulations within a jurisdiction – e.g., gender.
Analysis plan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the current package, it linked different sub-datasets in PISA: student, school, and country level data. The analysis is specifically focused on describing and explaining gender differences in students’ performances scores across countries. We compare different multi-level mixed-effect models and visualize the summary plots.

The next step is to identify and visualize countries that have “equitable” schooling outcomes and their characteristics in education systems, including student and school culture, teacher educational practices, and societal factors. That said, we caution against simplistic international comparisons of country performances using correlates of higher performance in higher ranking countries for projecting causal generalizations and statements.

Installation
------------
``PISAnalysisTool`` for its first version 0.1.0 is only compatible with Python 3. The installation steps are as below:

Option 1
^^^^^^^^
Install ``PISAnalysisTool`` through: ``pip install PISAnalysisTool``

Option 2
^^^^^^^^
1. For the git approach to install ``PISAnalysisTool`` you will need to begin by
cloning `PISAnalysisTool` repository on your own computer by using the following `git`
command:

``git clone https://github.com/nixiwang/PISAnalysisTool``

2. Next, to install the package you will need to go into the `PISAnalysisTool`
directory and run the ``setup.py`` file:

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd PISAnalysisTool/
        python setup.py install

3. To ensure that the dependencies to run ``PISAnalysisTool`` are installed on
 your computer you will want to both import the conda environment (for one of the R
 package) and pip installed components:

Create an environment from an exported env:
``bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
``
also you will run `pip install` the following command
``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``

You should now be ready to use, run ``pisa_analysis_tool`` as the package name, run example code, and
import the package on your computer.


Examples (How to use PISAnalysisTool)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To understand how to use PISAnalysisTool, please refer to
the [examples](https://github.com/nixiwang/PISAnalysisTool/tree/master/Examples
) section of this GitHub page where you can find
examples for doing the following:

- How to generate .csv file from .sav file for PISA 2015 data
- How to generate a list of interested variables along with ID info to a
csv data file for PISA data, including a demo on interactive PISA data generation, auto-scraping a small set of data for analysis
- A demo on generating World Bank data
- Cleaning the scraped data for the example
- How to generate multi-level models and visualize model summaries
- A demo on interactive model formula generation, for users to create model on their own
- Creating visualizations with the merged dataset on this example

User cases
^^^^^^^^^^
More specific user cases can be found in [function specifications doc.](https://github.com/nixiwang/PISAnalysisTool/blob/master/doc/Updated%20function%20specification/Function%20specification.md)

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^
In its current form, the PISAnalysisTool package serves as a very efficient data scraping and examplar analysis
tool, but not with customizable model estimation functioning, though the users directly use `pymer4` library as it is installed in our package, and call `Lmer` function directly
by passing the model paramter, which can be get using our formula generator tool.
The package also does not support ad hoc interactive visualization nor longitudinal analysis but can create an analysis
report for gender differences on students' performance for a given time frame.
